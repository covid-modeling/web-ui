    We implement an age-stratified SEIR model with additional categories
    for individuals exposed to the virus that are not yet infectious, severely sick
    people in need of hospitalization, people in critical condition, and a fatal category.
    The model is currently under active development and the US state level parameters are under review.

    We consider the feasibility and implications of strategies for COVID-19,
    looking at a range of NPI measures. It is important to note at the outset
    that given SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emergent virus, much remains to be
    understood about its transmission. In addition, the impact of many of the
    NPIs detailed here depends critically on how people respond to their
    introduction, which is highly likely to vary between countries and even
    communities.

    We’ve implemented a model for the spread of the virus which is an enrichment
    of the basic SEIR model with adjustments for distancing and adding PCR confirmation
    and Fatality states. This allows us to fit the solutions of the system of SEIR equations
    to actual data as reported by various states. We then use a combination of parameters
    from the fits and literature values to generate Monte Carlo simulations around the
    fit expectations to get a sense of our uncertainty in the projections.

    Covasim is a stochastic agent-based simulator designed to be used for COVID-19 (novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2) epidemic analyses.
    These include projections of indicators such as numbers of infections and peak hospital demand.
    Covasim can also be used to explore the potential impact of different interventions, including social distancing, school closures, testing, contact tracing, and quarantine.
